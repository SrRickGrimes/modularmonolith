## Technologies

The templates integrate several modern technologies and frameworks:

- **ASP.NET Core**: A framework for building web apps and services with .NET.
- **MediatR**: A simple, unambitious mediator implementation in .NET for in-process messaging.
- **FastEndpoints**: A minimalistic and fast endpoint API library for ASP.NET Core.
- **FluentValidation**: A popular .NET library for building strong validation rules.

## Templates Description

1. **Main Project Template**: This template sets up the primary project structure, incorporating all necessary configurations and base setups required for a Modular Monolith architecture.
2. **Module Template**: A secondary template that allows the creation of additional modules to plug into the main project. This facilitates the expansion and maintenance of the system as it grows.
